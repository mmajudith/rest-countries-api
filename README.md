This project "react chat application" is a web application that connents all React dev together.

Technologies Used:

- React
- Axios
- ant-design/icons for icons
- React-chat-engine as backend

But for anyone to join I have to add the person in the backend. I have not implemented a way for one to join in the frontend ie from the browser, looking for to do that
